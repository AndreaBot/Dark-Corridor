# Dark-Corridor

Dark Corridor is a retro-looking 2D game where the player navigates a corridor looting various items and fighting enemies.

At the start of the game, the player is able to pick a Hero of his/her choice and give it a custom name.

Rooms in the corridor have a random chance to either be empty, contain dirt, gold or a diamond, or spawn an enemy.
Each collected item is saved in an inventory page displaying the quantity for each item that as been collected as well giving the player a 
chance to drink a potion to restore some health.

The battles are handled in a similar way as in the Pokemon games: they are turned based, attacks have a chance to miss and
there are plenty of sound effects, text animations and on-screen messages to complete the experience.
There two different enemies: a weak "mutant pig" and a more powerful "possessed speellbook",
defeating them rewards the player with one or two soul items respectively.

For the end game there are two alternatives:
if the player dies in battle all resources are lots and zero points are awarded,
if the player leaves the corridor alive, he gets a certain amount of points based on the loot he/she managed to gather.
The player is free to leave the corridor at any point (not during a battle) but the more rooms he/she enters the more points can be collected.
